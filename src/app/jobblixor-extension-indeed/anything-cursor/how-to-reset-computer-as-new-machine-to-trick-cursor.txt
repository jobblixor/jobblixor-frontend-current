# 📝 Cursor Reset Method (Working Recipe)

### 1. **Prep Before Reinstall**

* Go to [cursor.com](https://cursor.com).
* **Sign out** of your old email.
* **Create a new email account** and sign up fresh (don’t reuse the old one).

---

### 2. **Delete Cursor Completely**

* Uninstall Cursor from Windows.
* Delete leftover folders: just search "C:\Users\zacka\AppData\Roaming" in file explorer and delete the folder that says "cursor". Also search "C:\Users\zacka" and also delete the folder that says .cursor.

  * `C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Roaming\Cursor`
  * `C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Local\Cursor`
  * (Empty Recycle Bin afterwards just to be safe.)

---

### 3. **Spoof MAC Address (the key step)**

1. Open **Registry Editor**:
   `Win + R → regedit → Enter`
   Navigate to:

   ```
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\
   {4d36e972-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}
   ```

2. Inside that folder, you’ll see numbered subkeys (`0000`, `0001`, etc.).

   * Click each until you find your real adapter (`DriverDesc` shows something like **Intel(R) Wi-Fi 6 AX201 160MHz**). THE SUBKEY FOR THIS IS 0001 BY THE WAY.

3. Add or edit the string:

   * Name: `NetworkAddress`
   * Value: **new 12-digit hex** (example: `02A1B2C3D4E5`)
   * ✅ Must start with `02`.
