1. If confused about anything in here please refer to chat "25 (Actual Chat with the latest prompts and files to where the content was written correctly)" in the jobblixor@gmail.com claude account.





2. Start every claude chat with this paste this at the top of the prompt before anything else: its very important you listen to the critical-instruction-for-file-fixes file or else this will not work out well:






3. Paste the CRITICAL-INSTRUCTION-FOR-FILE-FIXES file to claude in every new chat you start with it so the chances of it giving you a corrupted content.js are minimal.




4. Whenever claude stops the response mid code and it shows the continue button, press it, then stop claude, edit the prompt, delete "Continue" and replace it with this: Continue, with where you left off at the bottom of the artifact. 

THIS IS A CONTINUATION REQUEST (not a file modification):
- My previous response was cut off mid-sentence
- The artifact is INCOMPLETE and needs the rest of the code
- Use UPDATE function to append from exact cutoff point
- Find the exact last line as old_str, include same line + remaining code as new_str
- DO NOT use REWRITE - this would restart and corrupt the file
- DO NOT treat this as a file modification request

This is finishing an incomplete response, not fixing a complete file. Before proceeding, confirm you understand by stating:
"This is a CONTINUATION request. I will use UPDATE to append from the exact cutoff point, not REWRITE the entire file." Use update stop using rewrite

If claude is still fucking up add this to the continue prompt: You are using rewrite stop it this instant and use update please process and think for a few seconds and let it sink in about what im saying before you continue

And even if claude is still messing up say "its all messed up" then it will ask what is messed up then say whatever file is messed up i said "the updated background.js" and then it just fixed it.





4.5. Alright this is just something I wanted to add in here so for a while I've had to paste the continue prompt into claude a few times and the first 3 times claude was doing everything right with the content.js and then after the 4th time i sent the continue prompt claude started continuing with my code from the top instead of the bottom resulting in it giving me a corrupted content.js despite me telling it all of the prompts. But this time I did something differently, I let claude finish my content.js despite it being corrupted and then when it was done saying here is your content.js I went back to the continue prompt the one before V4 of my content.js before claude messed up the instructions and I just resent the prompt again without changing anything to it and then it gave me a perfectly fine content.js 

So long story short if after you paste the continue prompt if claude suddenly starts fucking up after a random time of sending the continue prompt even after the first 2 or 3 times it was working great let it finish with the fucked up content.js and then when it's done go back up to the continue prompt where everything started going wrong and resend it and then a functional content.js should be printed out in the claude artifact. (Idk if this method will actually work long term I just did it once and it worked so I will need to keep testing i more later)

Refer to chat "26" in the jobblixor claude account to actually see what happened.







5. Paste this to claude everytime you just want to make surgical updates to the ful content.js in the artifact: You can now use the UPDATE function for regular file modifications since we have the complete file in the artifact. So when you send me issues to fix, You can:

Use UPDATE to modify specific sections that need changes
Make targeted edits to the problematic code
Not have to rewrite the entire file from scratch

This makes sense - now that the complete working file is in the artifact, UPDATE becomes the right tool for making incremental fixes and improvements.
I'll send you the ChatGPT prompt with the current issues, and you'll use UPDATE to make the specific fixes needed.




6. These prompts won't always work 100%, so if a new claude chat is not continuing with the content.js like it should be don't try to fight it or find out why it got it wrong unless something has seriously changed. Instead just start a new claude chat with the same prompts and things should work again.




7. If claude makes a mistake with the content.js as it this so we can find out why it made the mistake despite having the critical instructions file so we can figure out what we need to improve with it so it doesn't fuck up again: Alright so what caused you to go out and make that mistake and what do i need to add in the critical instructions file so you dont make this mistake again the next time i start a new chat with you?



8. If claude is still having problems go to chat "Problem Solver" in the jobblixor@gmail.com account and continue to solve there.
